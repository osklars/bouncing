# bouncing
A project about the newtonian physic model of elastic friction free balls in a two dimensional playground.
The program is supposed to be a graphical simulation of n number of balls moving and colliding with each other and the edges of the playground. The balls are of random size and mass and initial location and speed. It works in frames and for each frame the balls move and if they collide they are rearranged so that the movement was instead made in the new direction calculated from the elastic collision.
